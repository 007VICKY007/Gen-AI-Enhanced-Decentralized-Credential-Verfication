# Generative AI-Enhanced Decentralized Credential Verification System

In an era where the need for secure and efficient credential verification is increasingly vital, traditional methods of verifying academic and professional qualifications face numerous challenges, including inefficiency, fraud susceptibility, and limited control for users over their data. This project, titled "Generative AI-Enhanced Decentralized Credential Verification System", seeks to revolutionize how credentials are managed, verified, and shared by leveraging emerging technologies like blockchain, NFTs, and generative AI.

Problem Statement:
The process of credential verification is often slow, labor-intensive, and prone to manipulation. Individuals and organizations must rely on time-consuming third-party verification, which can delay hiring, admissions, and various other processes. Moreover, existing centralized systems are vulnerable to data breaches and lack transparency, resulting in a loss of trust in the credentialing process. This project aims to address these issues by creating a decentralized platform that uses advanced technologies to automate and secure the entire process.

## System Architecture:
Frontend:
Developed using React.js to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.
Uses Redux for state management and Axios for secure API interactions.
Backend:
Built using Node.js with Express for managing business logic and handling API requests.
Uses MongoDB for securely storing user profiles, metadata, and transaction logs.
Implements JWT for secure API endpoint protection and user authentication.
Blockchain Integration:
Smart contracts written in Solidity to manage credential issuance and verification on the Polygon network.
Utilizes Web3.js in the frontend to interact with deployed smart contracts.
AI Integration:
Employs a generative AI model (e.g., OpenAI’s GPT) to analyze user data and provide recommendations.

## Expected Outcomes:
Enhanced Efficiency: Streamlined credential verification processes reduce the time required for issuance and validation.
Increased Trust and Transparency: Secure blockchain storage and NFT representation foster greater confidence in the authenticity and ownership of credentials.
User Empowerment and Control: Individuals gain more control over their personal data and how it is shared or verified.
Personalized Career Insights: Generative AI provides tailored recommendations to users, helping them navigate their career paths effectively.
Robust Security and Data Integrity: Strong encryption and decentralized storage ensure that sensitive data is protected from unauthorized access and manipulation.

## Project Overview
This project utilizes a combination of blockchain (Polygon network), NFTs, and AI to enhance the credential verification process. It aims to provide a user-centric platform where individuals can control, verify, and share their academic and professional credentials securely.

## Key Features
- **Decentralized Credential Issuance and Verification**
- **NFT-Based Credentials**
- **Generative AI for Personalized Career Recommendations**
- **User Dashboard with Real-Time Status Updates**
- **Secure Authentication and Role-Based Access Control**

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, Redux, Material-UI
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, JWT
- **Blockchain**: Polygon Network, Solidity, Web3.js
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI's GPT model
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Orkes Conductor

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js (v14+)](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB (v4.4+)](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [MetaMask Extension](https://metamask.io/) for interacting with the blockchain.
- [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) (for local blockchain testing)
- [Verbwire API Key](https://verbwire.com/) for issuing NFTs.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/credential-verification-system.git
cd credential-verification-system
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

#### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

#### Backend
```bash
cd ../backend
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables
Create an `.env` file in both `frontend` and `backend` directories. Add the following variables:

**Backend `.env`**:
```bash
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
VERBWIRE_API_KEY=your_verbwire_api_key
POLYGON_RPC_URL=your_polygon_rpc_url
CONDUCTOR_API_URL=your_orkes_conductor_api_url
CONDUCTOR_API_KEY=your_orkes_conductor_api_key
```

**Frontend `.env`**:
```bash
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
REACT_APP_WEB3_PROVIDER_URL=your_web3_provider_url
```

### 4. Smart Contract Deployment
Install [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) for smart contract development.

```bash
# Install Truffle globally
npm install -g truffle

# Navigate to the smart-contracts directory
cd ../smart-contracts

# Compile and deploy contracts to local blockchain (Ganache)
truffle compile
truffle migrate --network development
```

### 5. Initialize MongoDB Database
Make sure MongoDB is running locally or provide a connection string in the `MONGO_URI` environment variable.

```bash
# Start MongoDB
mongod --dbpath /path_to_your_database_folder
```

## Configuration
1. **MetaMask**: Connect MetaMask to the local or Polygon test network.
2. **Verbwire API Key**: Ensure your Verbwire API key is correctly configured to mint NFTs.
3. **Orkes Conductor**: Set up your Orkes Conductor instance and add the API URL and key in the `.env` file.

## Running the Project
